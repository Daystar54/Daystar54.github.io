        <h2>Capturing the First-Ever Image of a Black Hole.</h2>
        <h5>Black hole picture. Nov 7, 2021</h5>
        <div><a href="https://ibb.co/znt5Zsz"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ngK0jrF/istockphoto-682299464-612x612-1.jpg" alt="istockphoto-682299464-612x612-1" border="0"></a></div>
        <p> <font size="2px"> Black holes have always been a mystery in space, but recently, scientists did something amazing ‚Äì they captured an image of a black hole! This mind-blowing achievement was like solving a giant cosmic puzzle. The picture shows a dark circle surrounded by a glowing ring of gas and dust, and it's located millions of light-years away from Earth. <br>
<br>
Imagine this: a black hole is a spot in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. It's like a vacuum cleaner for everything around it! To get this picture, scientists used a network of powerful telescopes all over the world, working together like a team of cosmic detectives. They collected data for days and turned it into an image using some super-smart computer programs.<br>
<br>
Looking at the image, it's like peering into the unknown. The bright ring around the black hole is caused by super-hot particles swirling at nearly the speed of light. This is something we've never seen before! It's like capturing a monster's shadow in space. The black hole picture doesn't just show us what a black hole looks like ‚Äì it's a glimpse into the forces and mysteries that shape our universe.<br>
<br>
In the end, this image is more than just a photograph. It's proof that when scientists work together, they can uncover the secrets of the universe. The black hole picture isn't just for scientists in fancy labs; it's for all of us who wonder about the vastness of space and the incredible things it holds. </font> </p>

        <h2>A Stunning Night Sky with Abundant Stars Seen.</h2>
        <h5>A lot of stars, Feb 17, 2022</h5>
        <div><a href="https://ibb.co/XS5rdjk"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/nz1NV68/50921-1.jpg" alt="50921-1" border="0"></a></div>
        <p> <font size="2px"> Hey guys, guess what? So, scientists have this super cool new picture, and get this ‚Äì it's not just one or two stars, it's like a gazillion of them, all crammed into this jaw-dropping view! Imagine looking up at the night sky and seeing way more stars than you thought existed. It's like someone sprinkled glitter across the whole universe. And that's not even the best part ‚Äì they took this picture from the top of a ginormous mountain. Like, seriously, this mountain is so huge that it's like they're standing on top of the world. <br>
<br>
I mean, who would've thought you could capture so much beauty in just one shot? It's like they're giving us a sneak peek into a whole other realm, way up high. The stars are twinkling like they're putting on a show just for us. And the mountain? It's like this majestic giant that's been around for ages, watching over everything. It kind of makes you feel small, but in a good way, you know? It's like a reminder of how vast and amazing the universe really is. <br>
<br>
So, next time you're gazing up at the stars, just think about how we're all part of this incredible cosmic dance. And hey, maybe someday we'll get to climb that mountain ourselves and see the stars up close. Until then, let's just keep being amazed by the wonders of the universe, one picture at a time! </font></p>
